# YOLOv4-License-Plate-detector
YOLOv4 trained on custom license plate dataset
Model trained on Google Colab using Darknet neural network framework
License Plate Dataset collected from Open Images Dataset V6
The dataset was converted to the YOLOV4 format using the OIDv4 Toolkit
The model was trained on 1500 images and validated using 300 images
The size of images while training were fixed to 416x416 to avoid the system from crashing
The original model was trained for 1700 iterations
